### About `cse.unl.edu`

`cse.unl.edu` contains the source code and creative works for my web site
at the Computer Science and Engineering department (now known as the
School of Computing) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

This repository for twofold purposes:
1. To ensure that my web site code is available for practical reasons; and
2. To demonstrate the ease by which code of any kind can be shared as free
software and, hopefully, encourage others to do so with their own code.
